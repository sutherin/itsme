    <h2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 80px;">Hi, I'm Surin</h2>

    <br>
    
    <p>
        I grew up mingling in international and monocultural backgrounds.
        Such early experience has made me a shapeshifter, an extremely outgoing weirdo, 
        and someone with the biggest spectrum of interests.
        I identify as a wandering soul among my friends and family. 
        You could tell from the main page that I’ve done many things that are not of any links. 
        <br><br>
        I major in Economics and decided to double major in Art&Technology.
        Maybe I will settle down in the financial field to build a career as a businesswoman.
        Or I could barge my way through to be a daring designer.
        Perhaps I could be an accomplished marketer in fashion or beauty. Who knows.
        <br><br>
        Here’s my journey of interests. Hope you find it ridiculous or appealing.
        Either will make me grin. Welcome to my random train of thoughts.
